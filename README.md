## Description

As humans, we have a lot of tasks to accomplish, but often we donâ€™t use our time efficiently. Sometimes we do nonessential tasks just to feel like we are accomplishing something, or sometimes we do what is right in front of us instead of tasks that are actually higher priority.

One method of task prioritization is called the Eisenhower Matrix, where tasks are ranked according to urgency and importance and plotted on a graph. However, this can become cumbersome and time-consuming to do by hand. This can be solved by using  Task Matrix, an app where tasks are immediately plotted on a graph, and listed according to highest priority. Task Matrix makes it easy to maximize your productivity!

## Getting Started

In order to get started the user will simply need to fork and clone the repository from GitHub.

### Prerequisites

Softwares used in creating this application includes:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

The application's repository may require alterations to lines of codes if used with other softwares that are not listed above.

### Installation

1. To run this application, the user should fork the repository onto their own GitHub account. In the user's repository, the user should copy the link and clone the repository onto their local system. Navigate to the repository folder using the terminal and run command line `npm install`
   - `$ cd ../Emily-Schwartau-solo-project`
   - `$ npm install`

<br />

2. Create a .env file in the repository folder and insert in the following lines with the placeholder variables.

   SERVER_SESSION_SECRET="`strongPassword`" <br />

   Replace `strongPassword` with a strong password of the user's choice or use [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) to generate a password to replace it with.

<br />

3.  Create a local postgreSQL database called `task_matrix` with Postico using the command lines from the database.sql file. Using different database systems may require the user to alter or add additional command lines to reflect the example database provided.

<br />

4. To start up the application, enter in the terminal the npm command lines of:

   - `npm run server`
   - `npm run client`

   The server should be running on `http://localhost:5000` whereas the client should be on `http://localhost:3000`. Both the server and the client is required to be up and running for the application to run successfully.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, the user should be redirected to the browser with the application loaded. If not, open up a browser and enter in the url:

http://localhost:3000

Users must register and login before using the Task Matrix app. 

- Users may add a task by clicking on the plus icon in the lower righthand corner that will redirect the user to a form
